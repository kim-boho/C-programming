(gdb) display mainA
No symbol "mainA" in current context.
(gdb) display mainB
No symbol "mainB" in current context.

-> Since mainA and mainB is local variable of main function, they are not accessible in swap function.
x and y just copied their value.



Breakpoint 3, swap (x=20000, y=1) at swap.c:21
4: y = 1
3: x = 20000
(gdb) display x
5: x = 20000
(gdb) display y
6: y = 1

-> x and y were swapped.

1: mainA = 1
(gdb) display mainA
7: mainA = 1
(gdb) display mainB
8: mainB = 20000
(gdb) display x
No symbol "x" in current context.
(gdb) display y
No symbol "y" in current context.

-> mainA and mainB were not swapped.
Since x and y are local variable of swap function, they vanished when swap function was ended.
